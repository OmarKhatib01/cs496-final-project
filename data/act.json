As head of the community center he went after every existing grant on the city and state level to bring them puppet shows with the message to avoid drugs and stay in school; and plays in the park such as actors Night's Dream. Abshu believed there was something in Shakespeare for everyone, even the young of Brewster Place, and if he broadened their horizons just a little bit, there might be enough room for some of them to would not be a perfect world, but definitely one with more room than they had now. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The kids who hung around the community center liked Abshu, because he never preached and it was in on the kid who had a real problem. It might be an offhand remark while shooting a game of pool or a one- on-one out on the basketball court, but he had a way of making them feel special with just a word or two.\u00a0 stayed together. There were four of them who ended up in foster care: him, two younger sisters, and a baby brother. He understood why his mother did what she did, but he couldn't help wondering if there might have\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Abshu was put into a home that already had two other boys from foster care. The Masons lived in a small wooden bungalow right on the edge of Linden Hills. And Mother Mason insisted that they tell any-\u00a0 Hills, a more prestigious address than Summit Place. It was a home that was kept immaculate. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But what he remembered most about the Masons was that it seemed there was never quite enough to eat.\u00a0 a half sandwiches\u2014white bread spread with margarine and sprinkled with sugar\u2014and half an apple. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Abshu dreamed of leaving\u2014which was every day\u2014he had his own apartment with a refrigera-\u00a0 day and night. The Masons weren\u2019t mean people; he knew he could have ended up with a lot worse. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Abshu lived with these people for nine years, won a scholarship to the local college, and moved out to\u00a0 nut shop. By this time his mother was ready to take her children back home, but he decided that since he was already out on his own he would stay there. One less mouth for her to worry about feeding. And after he\u00a0 be able to give her a little money to help her along. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One thing he did thank the Masons for was keep- ing him out of gangs. There was a strict curfew in their home that was rigidly observed. And church was\u00a0 Mason always said, \u201cyou can do whatever you want, but in my home you do as I say.\u201d No, they weren't mean people, but they were stingy\u2014stingy with their food and with their affection. Existing that way all the\u00a0 gave Abshu an appreciation for a life fully lived. Do whatever job makes you happy, regardless of the cost; and fill your home with love. Well, his home became the community center right around the corner from was working with young kids. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The kids who hung out at the community center weren\u2019t all lost yet. They wanted to make use of the tutors for their homework; and they wanted a safe place\u00a0 And on occasion when that happened, he went home to cry. But he never let his emotions show at work. To the kids he was just a big, quiet kind of dude who didn't go looking for trouble, but he wouldn\u2019t run from it either.\u00a0 showed up at the center. He made it real clear to them that this was his territory\u2014his rules\u2014and if they needed to flex their muscles, they were welcome to try. And he showed many that just because he was kind, it\u00a0 in their world, some kind of discipline. And if they understood that, then he worked with them, long and hard, to let them see that they could make a differ- ence in their own lives.  ",

Should indi- viduals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should trolling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \u201che doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . a wild beast.\u201d Modern standards of legal responsibility, of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel\u2019s secretary. Everyone senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014 not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \u201cirresistible impulse,\u201d which recognizes -rectly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity \u201cA person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appre -ciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his -stantial\u00a0suggests that \u201cany\u201d incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \u201ctotal\u201d incapacity is not required either. The use of the word\u00a0appreciate rather than\u00a0know\u00a0implies that intellectual awareness of some understanding of the moral or legal consequences of their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The problem of legal responsibility in the case of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recom -mendation are varied. Many experts believe that the and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant\u2019s mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an\u00a0indeterminate\u00a0sentence to an institution for the criminally insane that may con- prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort. In California in 1980, only 259 defendants (out of approximately 52,000) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.  ",

You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her image of your face has become an enduring memory in her mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby\u2019s ear, carrying the electrically encoded cortex. \u201cMa\u201d has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant\u2019s brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby\u2019s brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primi- baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scientists are just now realizing how experiences actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experi- ences shape the brain\u2019s circuits. more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain\u2019s basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn\u2019t come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimula- the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is some- thing much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned mea- sures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them per- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in infants lose their \u201cstartle\u201d and \u201crooting\u201d reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brain is fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child\u2019s first decade of life.\n  ",

Everything was subservient to the disposal of the tides. When the tide was low, Mom could be found down on the mudflats. When the tide was high, she would be standing on the inlet bridge with her plankton net. I have great respect for my mother. I learned early that the moon affected the tides. Mom was always waiting for a full or new moon, when low tide would be lower than average and high tide higher than average. The moon being aligned with Earth and the sun when full or new, so its gravity combines with the sun\u2019s gravity to create an even stronger gravitational pull. I knew that it took about eight hours for the tides to change from high to low, sixteen hours for a complete cycle of tides. I didn\u2019t have to wait to learn these things in school.

My father was an avid gardener, he still is: and every Saturday morning he would put on his work clothes, pick up his hoe and trowel, and would head out the back door. 3 [2]     As a ten-year-old, I was supremely unenthusiastic about swinging a hoe in the garden when I could be out playing with my friends. Having tried and failed, my father was unable to make a gardener of me. I had no qualms, of course, about enjoying the results of his labor: the potatoes, squash, cucumbers, and cauliflower that he pursued out of the earth. I would even help him dig out the potatoes or cut a cucumber from its vine. To me, it was much more fun to reap than sowing. [3]     Many years later, living in an upstairs apartment, I am more often sorry I didn\u2019t follow my father out to the garden. I have several indoor plants, but the experience is not the same. The few times that I\u2019ve helped a friend with yard work has given me the joy of touching the soil with an open palm, to get the earth under my fingernails, of patting down the berm around a newly transplanted sapling. Now that I live far from my father (I live in Iowa on the other side of the world), I wish I\u2019d spend more time with him in the garden. [4] My favorite photograph of my father shows him squatting on his heels, trowel in hand, behind a golden heap of onions freshly pulled from the ground. His glowing smile are evidence of his pride in the onions\u2014the proof of his labor and love\u2014and in me, the photographer, his son. In that photo, his love of the land and his love for me are somehow intertwined, indivisible. It is that same love\u2014love of kin, love of land\u2014that pushes under my fingernails, pushes against my skin, when I thrust my hand into the yielding earth and think that on its far side my father might be doing the same.

The instrument responsible for this sound is the antara, or Andean panpipe, known for the hollow-sounding, breathy notes it creates. The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once the more richer and more powerful empire in South America.     The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up. The pipes, which can vary numerously from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before being bound to the other pipes.     The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument have come from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the remaining tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum.     [1] Due to the limited number of notes that can be played on an antara, early musicians\u2019 most likely worked in groups, coordinating the timing and pitch of their instruments to extend the range of sounds produced. [2] Other pottery images show two antara players facing each other while dancing. [3] Each player holds a set of pipes so that both sets are connected to the other set by a string, as if to suggest that those two antaras should be played together. [4] Even to this day, descendants of the Incas, the Quechua people of Peru and Bolivia, prefer to play matched antaras bound together.     Unfortunately, the music of the Incas can probably never be exactly re-creating.

The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum.     [1] Due to the limited number of notes that can be played on an antara, early musicians\u2019 most likely worked in groups, coordinating the timing and pitch of their instruments to extend the range of sounds produced. [2] Other pottery images show two antara players facing each other while dancing. [3] Each player holds a set of pipes so that both sets are connected to the other set by a string, as if to suggest that those two antaras should be played together. [4] Even to this day, descendants of the Incas, the Quechua people of Peru and Bolivia, prefer to play matched antaras bound together.     Unfortunately, the music of the Incas can probably never be exactly re-creating. Yet one can hear in the music of their descendants, beautiful variations on a musical sound that has survived for many centuries.\n ",

Therefore, suffragists (those who advocated extending voting rights to women) wanted the Democrats\u2019 platform to support women\u2019s right to vote.

[5] They donned yellow sashes over white dresses and held yellow umbrellas aloft as they lined both sides of Locust Street between the convention delegates\u2019 hotel and the meeting hall. 7     At the end of the \u201cGolden Lane,\u201d as the event was also called, Gellhorn organized a three-tiered \u201cliving tableau,\u201d which a live scene was presented by silent, costumed participants. Women wearing white represented states where women could vote. Others wore gray to represent states with partial suffrage (women could vote in school board elections, for example). Women draped in black represented states that refused women the vote. This group held out manacled hands to them as a reminder that, without the vote, women were deprived of their freedom. At the top of the tiers, stood a woman dressed as Lady Liberty.     Edna Gellhorn witnessed a victory that year when votes for women would became part of the 1916 Democratic Party\u2019s _ platform. Then finally in August 1920, after more than seventy years and countless parades, speeches, letters, and calls, the Nineteenth Amendment, to the U.S. Constitution, was ratified, thus giving all women the right to vote.\n ",
