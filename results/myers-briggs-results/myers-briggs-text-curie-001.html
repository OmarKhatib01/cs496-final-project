It is based on how you rated described yourself. A 4-letter personality type code is also presented for your convenience if you are familiar with that framework. Most people find their results match their 4-letter personality type code. That is, we tend to develop and utilize what we prefer and vice versa. As you reflect on your cognitive profile, keep in mind that sometimes we develop a cognitive process to meet the demands of our environment or use a process well in one area of our lives but not others.</p><p><b>The Eight Processes</b></p><p>Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Carl Jung identified four mental functions. Today we know them as cognitive processes. We focus our attention and gather information using Sensing (S) and iNtuiting (N), and we organize our experiences and make decisions using Thinking (T) and Feeling (F). Jung described how each of these four processes plays out in a person's "internal world" (I) of thoughts, feelings, memories, and imagination; and in the "external world" (E) of actions, people, tools, and organizations. Thus, there are eight cognitive processes (Se, Si, Ne, Ni, Te, Ti, Fe, Fi).</p><p><b>Basic and Developed Use</b></p><p>Each cognitive process can be engaged in a basic, unsophisticated way reflecting our natural human capabilities. Almost everyone can engage each process in some basic way. We often do every day. Beyond this, you will engage some cognitive processes in a more sophisticated, developed way. This is likely the result of innate preference plus lifelong growth and practice, which equals development.</p><p><b>Perceiving — how we focus our attention and gather information</b></p><blockquote><p><table width="525">  <tbody><tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2"><b>Cognitive Process</b></font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2"><b>Basic (Passive) Use</b></font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2"><b>Developed (Active) Use</b></font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2">extraverted Sensing (Se)</font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2">Notice sensory data in the environment.</font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2">Trust your instincts and take action relevant to the moment and current context.</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2">introverted Sensing (Si)</font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2">Recall tangible data and experiences.</font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2">Stabilize a situation by comparing it to what is expected, known and reliable.</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2">extraverted Intuiting (Ne)</font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2">Notice abstract patterns as they emerge.</font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2">Shift a situation's dynamics and explore imaginative potential possibilities.</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2">introverted Intuiting (Ni)</font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2">Receive "ah-ha" insights and realizations.</font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2">Pursue a greater level of awareness to transform who you are and how you think.</font></td>  </tr></tbody></table></p></blockquote><p><b>Judging — how we organize our experiences and make decisions</b></p><blockquote><p><table width="525">  <tbody><tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2"><b>Cognitive Process</b></font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2"><b>Basic (Passive) Use</b></font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2"><b>Developed (Active) Use</b></font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2">extraverted Thinking (Te)</font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2">Follow steps, points and time tables.</font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2">Create structure, reason by measures and evidence, and implement complex plans.</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2">introverted Thinking (Ti)</font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2">Adhere to definitions and impersonal principles.</font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2">Analyze a problem using a framework, and find an angle or leverage by which to solve it.</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2">extraverted Feeling (Fe)</font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2">Honor others' needs and preferences.</font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2">Connect with people by sharing values and taking on their needs as yours.</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="100"><font size="2">introverted Feeling (Fi)</font></td>    <td width="150"><font size="2">Adhere to personal beliefs about what's important.</font></td>    <td width="275"><font size="2">Evaluate situations and choose what you believe is congruent with your personal identity.</font></td>  </tr></tbody></table></p></blockquote><p>Development is more than basic or advanced use of processes in isolation. We can talk about a spectrum. Wise use of a cognitive process involves both basic and developed use as appropriate, plus an ability to deploy other processes in its service. Thus, thinking of a spectrum, "average" to "good" use usually means we can use the process in limited situations or use it well but only with the aid of other processes. In contrast, "poor" use means merely basic use or maybe inappropriate use. Finally, we may get ourselves into trouble when we don't utilize a process at all.</p><p><b>Your Cognitive Development Profile</b><br>The forty-eight questions you rated earlier tap into the eight cognitive processes.

Your two preferred cognitive processes allow you to do information gathering and decision making, introverting and extraverting. Maybe you prefer introverted Intuiting in a lead role with extraverted Feeling in a support role, or maybe you prefer extraverted Sensing in a lead role with introverted Thinking in a support role. Or maybe you prefer some other pairing. These pairings tap into sixteen possible patterns which are often represented using a 4-letter code. Here are the sixteen type patterns and the preferred cognitive processes associated with each:</p><blockquote><p><table border="0" width="400">  <tbody><tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2"><b>Type</b></font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2"><b>Lead Process</b></font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2"><b>Support Process</b></font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ESTP</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Sensing</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Thinking</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ISTP</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Thinking</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Sensing</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ESFP</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Sensing</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Feeling</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ISFP</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Feeling</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Sensing</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ESTJ</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Thinking</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Sensing</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ISTJ</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Sensing</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Thinking</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ESFJ</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Feeling</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Sensing</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ISFJ</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Sensing</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Feeling</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ENTJ</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Thinking</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Intuiting</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">INTJ</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Intuiting</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Thinking</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ENTP</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Intuiting</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Thinking</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">INTP</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Thinking</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Intuiting</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ENFJ</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Feeling</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Intuiting</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">INFJ</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Intuiting</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Feeling</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">ENFP</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Intuiting</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Feeling</font></td>  </tr>    <tr>    <td width="50"><font size="2">INFP</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">introverted Feeling</font></td>    <td width="175"><font size="2">extraverted Intuiting</font></td>  </tr></tbody></table></p></blockquote><p><b>Validity and Reliability of Results</b></p><p>This assessment underwent rigorous development with over 3000 people, and recent further validation with almost 130,000 respondents confirms validity. We used various validation methods, namely latent class analysis (with Cronbach alpha &gt;= 0.70). You can consider your results here as valid as those from any professionally-developed assessment. You can read more here: </p><ul><li><a href="http://keys2cognition.com/cgi/Dev-Report-CPA.pdf">the 2006 white paper</a>, and </li><li><a href="http://keys2cognition.com/cgi/Strong-Evidence-Jungs-8-Functions.pdf">the 2021 white paper</a></li></ul>In the original study, people who took this assessment and reported their 4-letter type code received results that matched their type code 75% to 80% of the time. This is excellent performance since the reported type may be inaccurate even when "validated" or from a professional assessment. And even when the type code does not exactly match, the central functional pair (e.g. SF, ST, NF, NT) matches 95% of the time.<p></p><p><b>Clarifying Your Result</b></p><p>What if the 4-letter code reported here is different from what you expected? Let's say that your type code result here is ESTP and the type you are familiar with for yourself is INTJ. Even though the type codes look quite different, you may have rated the cognitive processes for these two types rather closely. Also, keep in mind the cognitive profile is based on your responses. Continuing with the example, if you didn't think of yourself as an ESTP, then you would reflect on why you rated highly a phrase such as "freely follow your gut instincts and exciting physical impulses as they come up." This phrase clearly does not fit with the INTJ type pattern.
